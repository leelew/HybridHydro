# HybridHydro | hybrid physical-ML models for soil moisture prediction

V2 codes is slightly different from V1 codes (shown in branch `main`). We trained model with [paper](10.21105/joss.04050) strategy, i.e., train global model with all possible datasets (means more training samples). The preliminary test shows that it get nearly the same training result with V1 codes in soil moisture forecasting.
